## About This Repo

This repo serves as a central hub for my cloud computing projects, notes, and infrastructure-as-code. Iâ€™m focusing mainly on AWS and Terraform, with a mix of hands-on labs, scripting, and best practices.

Here youâ€™ll find:

- General roadmap and goals  
- Scripts and automation helpers  
- Infrastructure configurations  
- Daily logs capturing lessons, commands, and outcomes

## Structure

- `/scripts/` â€” Helper scripts like credential loaders  
- `/terraform/` â€” Terraform configurations organized by project or day  
- `/Daily Log/` â€” Daily detailed notes, walkthroughs, and progress reports

## How to Use This Repo

- Follow the daily logs to see step-by-step progress  
- Reuse Terraform configurations for your own projects  
- Learn from troubleshooting notes and command snippets  
- Keep sensitive info safe by respecting `.gitignore`
