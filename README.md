## About This Repo

This repo serves as a central hub for my cloud computing projects, notes, and infrastructure-as-code. Iâ€™m focusing mainly on AWS and Terraform, with a mix of hands-on labs, scripting, and best practices.

Here youâ€™ll find:

- General roadmap and goals  
- Scripts and automation helpers  
- Infrastructure configurations  
- Daily logs capturing lessons, commands, and outcomes

## Structure

- `/scripts/` â€” Helper scripts like credential loaders  
- `/terraform/` â€” Terraform configurations organized by project or day  
- `/Daily Log/` â€” Daily detailed notes, walkthroughs, and progress reports

## Progress

Currently working through:

- Day 1: Core AWS concepts, EC2 instance provisioning, and basic networking  
- Day 2: Custom VPC, public/private subnets, IGW & NAT gateway, security groups, EC2 with Terraform  
- Next up: Private subnet access, S3 integration, IAM roles, and Terraform remote state
